My First readme Updated
This is the first project I've worked on GitHub, using Ubuntu 20.04 on the Intranet sandbox.
With cloning, I created a directory in the terminal that adds changes to my repository on GitHub.
Not just that, there are several directories, with files and lines included in them.
This is all amazing thanks to the ALX Software Engineering Programme.
